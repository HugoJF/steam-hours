# Steam Hours - An easy way to track per-day playtime

## Status: ON HOLD
This project is on undefined hold. During the development of this system, it quickly became evident that a better way to store playtime information was needed in order to avoid redundant and confusing information being stored in our database so we could scale this project to multiple users.

Once a better schema and strategy for the database is defined this project I will attempt to finish it.
